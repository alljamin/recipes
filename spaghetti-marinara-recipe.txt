Ingredients:
 - 2 cups sugar
 - 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil, plus extra to toss
 - 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
 - 6 anchovy fillets
 - 2 x 400g can chopped tomatoes
 - 200ml dry white wine
 - 500g spaghetti
 - 300g mussels, scrubbed, debearded
 - 800g good-quality marinara mix
 - 200g peeled green prawns
 - Torn flat-leaf parsley leaves, to serve
 - SAXA Pink Himalayan Salt Flakes, to season

Directions:
 1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large frypan over medium-low heat and add garlic and 
    anchovies. Cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes until anchovies have melted. Add tomatoes
    and wine and bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes
    until slightly reduced.
 2. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to packet
    instructions. Drain, then return to the pan and toss in a little olive oil.
 3. Add the mussels to the pan of sauce, cover and cook for 1 minute, shaking the pan
    occasionally. Add the remaining seafood and cook for a further 2-3 minutes until the 
    marinara mix and prawns are cooked through and the mussels have opened (discard any 
    that havenâ€™t opened after this time). Season to taste with salt and freshly ground 
    black pepper. Add the drained pasta, toss to combine, then divide among bowls and 
    serve garnished with parsley leaves.
